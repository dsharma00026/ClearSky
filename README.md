## 📘 How I Built This

As a **BCA graduate and aspiring Laravel Developer**, this is my personal learning project to understand:

- Authentication in Laravel
- How to use external APIs
- Building reusable views using Blade
- Laravel validation and session handling
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap

This app was built from scratch without scaffolding like Laravel Breeze or Jetstream to learn everything manually.
